# Write-Up File

The program that we are going to be creating is a personality quiz that is going to take the responses from a user and categorize the response based on a number from 1 through 5. The most common number that appears for the user will be what quantifies what type of Smiling Friends character they will be. 

The classes that will be used are a quiz taker's information class, quiz answers class, and a personalities class. We have also thought about doing a questions type class, but are still in a debate about that for now.

The functions that we are going to need are a file generation to add the user's final personality and information (first name, last name, email, and phone number) to a pre-existing list of previous user's data. This will help to display a fun fact of what percentage of quiz taker's also got the same smiling friend. 

How the program will flow is each one of us will take on a class and be the "class master", explaining what the class does and what it's functionality is. Then, we will develop a set of questions by Xander and Ty, which will be based on the Smiling Friends that Evan chooses.
