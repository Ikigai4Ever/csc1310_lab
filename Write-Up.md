The program that we are going to be creating is a personality quiz that is going to take the responses from a user and categorize the response based on a number from 1 through 5. The most common number that appears for the user will be what quantifies what type of Smiling Friends character they will be. 

The classes that will be used are a quiz taker's information class, quiz answers class, and a personalities class. We have also thought about doing a questions type class, but are still in a debate about that for now.

The functions that we are going to need are a file generation to add the user's final personality and information (first name, last name, email, and phone number) to a pre-existing list of previous user's data. This will help to display a fun fact of what percentage of quiz taker's also got the same smiling friend. 

How the program will flow is each one of us will take on a class and be the "class master", explaining what the class does and what it's functionality is. Then, we will develop a set of questions by Xander and Ty, which will be based on the Smiling Friends that Evan chooses.

What our group had tried to do was create a personality quiz that categorized you based on charaters from the show Smililing Friends after answering 5 different questions. We also wanted to display information that told the user what percentile they were in compared to other participants that had previously answered and display that to the user. We were not successful in doing this percentage calculation for every question, however we did have a percentage that the quiz taker would fall into for what personality they got from the quiz based on previous quiz taker's results.

Our process was to communicate what was expected from our part of the program every week and independently work on it outside of class. We also texted one another asking if a section of the program looked good or if they were hitting the marks they needed to in reference to the program specifications. 

Some things that we could have done differently is getting a better head start on our program, developing the classes fully in the first one or two weeks of the project in order to work out bugs and create more functions if needed. However, we did have a great refresher as to how classes work and were able to create a more readable and organized program because of the classes. We also learned how to collaborate on a program with a group of others using GitHub as a platform to share and update the program at an instant.

The expected outcome of the program is to take in the quiz taker's first and last name, email, and phone number and place it into a text file with other previous quiz taker's information. Then in another file, the answers that the quiz taker gave to the ten questions will be placed in a separate text file that would have been used to calculate what percentile they would have been in for a specific question that they had answered. Then, after answering all of the questions, the character that they most relate to based on the questions they answered, an ASCII art will pop up along with what percentile they fell in for that character based on previous answers.

The TA will run the program using the testCase.txt file and see how Brandon Vandergriff would respond to the program!!! They can also take the quiz themselves to see what personality they relate with the most. 

This program was really fun, however I think doing a more hands training of how to learn how to use GitHub along with having the TA's know a little more about GitHub would be nice because it was confusing for the first couple of weeks. I know that we had the tutorial for GitKracken, but maybe something that was an extention in VSCode might have been something more easily learnable would have been nice. Maybe some more YouTube videos or something similar would be good.
