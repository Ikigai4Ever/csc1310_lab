## Program Description

We will be creating a program that is a personality test that will put someone in a percentile of similar responses/personalities. This information will be gathered previously out of 100 people and the person taking the quiz will have their answers and final results added into the orgional information.

## Program Outline

We will take in the user's information (first and last name, email, phone number) and put it into a text file. Then they will take a multiple choice quiz with a set number of questions to put them into a category of personality based on previous responses.
