## Program Description

We will be creating a program that is a personality test that will put someone in a percentile of similar responses/personalities. This information will be gathered previously out of 100 people and the person taking the quiz will have their answers and final results added into the orgional information. The theme will be Smiling Friendss

## Program Outline

We will take in the user's information (first and last name, email, phone number) and put it into a text file. Then they will take a multiple choice quiz with a set number of questions to put them into a category of personality based on previous responses. We will calculate the personality type based on a range of whole number and decimal values from 1 to 5 to categorize them into a personality.
